<p>Below you will find the synopsis for Coherence. I had seen the movie three times prior 
and then I transcribed while rewatching it twice to create this compendium, so this should 
be fairly exhaustive. As seen above, the black text is the initial (in truth, 4th) time I 
watched Coherence, while the red text is notes from my rewatch. Between the viewings I did 
research (see <a href="science.html">The Science</a>) and developed my theories and 
questions. In the version presented below, my distinct viewings are indistinguishable 
but that is irrelevant. It is a roughly 25 minute read of what happens in the movie with little commentary.</p>
