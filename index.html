<h2 class="question">Do you know your friends? Do you know what's real? Do you know yourself?</h2>

<p>This website represents an attempt to fully analyze James Ward Byrkit’s Coherence (2013) 
and present a comprehensive dissection of the film. Byrkit creates a fascinating story with 
so much depth, it calls for multiple viewings to fully grasp the intricate details. I would 
highly recommend seeing the film before continuing on, as there will be extensive spoilers. <br>
I don’t really expect anyone to read everything on this site, I completely fell down the rabbit hole.</p>
